# virtual_assistant
virtual assistant made as apart of the January codeJam

I am going to periodically update this README file as I move throughout the project

January 5th 2020. This is my first attempt at any form of AI. Currently im just getting started with forming my understanding. I am doing this by jumping around from sources on the internet to learn 
about and create a virtual assistant using python and downloaded PIP packages.
